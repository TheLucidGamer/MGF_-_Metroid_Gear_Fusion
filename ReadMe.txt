Ever thought ADAM could have more interesting things to say?

Ever felt like Samus should SPEAK more in her own game (outside of her inner monologues)? 

Then my friend, this hack is for you!

	Simply patch the .bps file to your ROM ("Metroid Fusion (U).gba" or similar) either through
	your Emulator or using Flips Patcher. If there are any bugs, please be sure to log them and

		** This Hack only effects the English Language Text. 
		   Every other language is unchanged.

~~~~~~

	Put simply, this hack is an overhaul to the Navigation Room Dialogues that tie Vanilla MF (Metroid Fusion) together. Be it minor edits or alterations of existing story dialogue, or complete overhauls of simple "Do the thing" optional dialogues. The primary goal of these edits being to not only give Samus more presence in the story by actually conversing with ADAM, but also to make their trust and developing companionship more fleshed out and developed through the Mandatory Conversations, and loosely through Optional Dialogues.

	Regardless of either event, the General Story of Vanilla MF (from beginning to end) is largely unchanged, with only a handful of extra text or active "rewriting" of story beats sprinkled about. As the Hack's name suggests: Consider these dialogues like how Codec Conversations are in the Metal Gear Solid series. An extension of the story rather than a full replacement.

~~~

	When interacting with a Navigation Pad/Samus's Ship, the player will always be treated to one of two things: 

	- The Mandatory Mission Briefing (MDT) for the active event

	- A separate, Optional Dialogue (OP) shared between Samus and ADAM

	Mandatory Briefings follow the same path they always do; Normally with ADAM talking about what the Objective of the Event is, and telling Samus where to go/what to do. The only differences for these compared to Vanilla MF are minor quips or short exchanges between Samus and ADAM that serve to build character and flesh out the relationship between the two. Usually only an extra line or two of dialogue, or a brief elaboration on something Objective Related.

	Optional Dialogues, however, are where a majority of the Hack's time is placed, and what takes up most of the rewriting. In Vanilla MF, these Dialogues are nothing more than Adam quickly saying "do the thing" regarding your objective; more or less just parroting your Pause Screen Objective prompt, OR can be asides that occur during non major events; say Unlocking a Security Door or getting an upgrade free of the main objective for the Sector. Obviously, this dialogue may as well be unused, seeing as most poeple in both casual and optimal play, rarely if ever are going to need to see this dialogue. As such, every instance of Optional Navigation Room Dialogue has been effectively repurposed, fully rewritten from the ground up with a number of things:

	- Brief exchanges between Samus & ADAM
	- Lore (Both real/canon, and made-up for flavor text & World Building)
	- References to Metroid Material/Characters
	- References to Nintendo Material/Characters
	- References to Sci-Fi Materials/Culture
	- References to Metal Gear Solid (The most gratuitous conversations. Sorry)

	*** It should be noted that as of current, once a Navigation Room is interacted with, it cannot be skipped or closed.
	If you interact with a Machine, but didn't mean to, best bet is to pick the MDT Briefing as it is usually the shortest. This is currently being looked into and 	will be the apart of the first patch.

==============================
	IMPORTANT NOTE
==============================

	Considering the Nature of this hack, there was a lot to think about in regards to Samus's characterization. I didn't want her to be too stoic and broody (a-la whatever the Christ Other M was doing), but I also didn't want to make her too much of the opposite of that either. It took a lot of thinking, but looking over Samus's actions and behavior over the Metroid Franchise (Not just games, Mangas too), I believe I struck a pretty reasonable balance that can be described relatively simply:

	 "A brave, valiant, stalwart, and compassionate warrior who always tries to protect the innocent and thwart the forces of evil... That happens to be a TIRED, reckless, stubborn, and routinely impulsive dork".

	She's no doubt a seasoned bounty hunter with quite a history to back up her skill and prowess, but she's also someone who has >in fact< seen a locked door, opened it out of curiosity, and then gotten sucked out into space without realizing that the door was an airlock. She is, of course, a seriously imposing character. But she is also a Nintendo character. As much as she is played straight in the main story, I felt comfortable giving Samus more silly or comedic banter with ADAM in more than a handful of the optional dialogues. Nothing that I feel interferes with the narrative by any means, and is ultimately little more than "character flavoring". Not meant to be taken seriously, and fun to read regardless.

    CHANGELOG:
--------------------------------

2:47 AM 4/9/2023 ~ 0.1.0 (Pre-Release):

	---Primary---
	* All story dialogues have been touched up and rewritten
	* Optional Dialogues are almost all completely new unless deemed inapropriate for the Main Story. Length of dialogues may vary.
	* Instead of "Confirm Mission Objective", you are given a choice between MDT Nav Conversations, or OP Nav Conversations.
	  MDT is the Main Briefing for the event you're on, and OP is the Optional Side-Conversation for that event.

	---Secondary---
	* Tweaked Samus's Palette around for fun (room sprites only, no cutscenes. Don't know where
	  those are in the rom). Visors shift color form Blue to Green the more suits you acquire. May be 
	  reverted back in future releases.
	* Made use of a Prototype room by altering it's design to house a moved hidden E-Tank (If
	  you've played Fusion, you'll know which one it is.)
	* QOL: Some 100% Rooms have been simplified because those rooms can go to hell. Specifically
	  Crumble Block City and Babies First Shinespark Chain.
